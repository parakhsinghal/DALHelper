<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>
The DALHelper is a project that was born out of my needs to connect to SQL Server database for my projects. I generally work on projects and design them using domain model and to keep them flexible, understandable and fast, I prefer to connect to the database
 using ADO.NET. Writing ADO.NET commands to connect to database can become monotonous and repetitive. Using Microsoft's Enterprise Library's Data Access Application Block is one solution, but I generally find it requiring a bit more effort than should be invested.
 Of course it gives you the freedom to change your supporting back end database. Generally back end databases in applications do not change, specially in enterprise environments and small applications for which the express version of SQL Server can be sufficient,
 and if you work with such applications then, I believe DALHelper can make your life a bit easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: This library cannot be used with any other database other than SQL Server, as it is built upon SQL Server specific ADO.NET commands.</p>
<p>In future I plan, to extend this library into a framework, supporting various data sources such as XML, Excel, CSV files etc.</p>
